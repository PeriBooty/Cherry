## What to do when you want to contribute?
What you should do if you want to contribute, is simply fork the repo, make your changes and make a pull request! SoraKatadzuma or
other contributors may make comments on the code, asking for revisions before the pull will be acceptable.

## What should I contribute?
If you know anything about compiler design and development and you know enough Java to start writing a compiler, in Java, then all you need
to do is:
- Look through whatever there already is in the repo.
  - Doing this will show what hasn't been done and it could also point out errors or even improvements.
- Figure out what you can do that hasn't been done yet or that needs to be fixed.
  - There are two ways to go about this, you could A) register an issue to have it changed or fixed, or B) make the changes yourself and make a pull request.
- Once you've figured out what you can add or fix, do it!
  - Pretty simply, you can do most of the stuff yourself and ask us to add it in to the master repo.
  
## Are you sure there aren't any guidlines for contributing?
Not exactly, no. The only thing we ask of our code contributors is to: 1) document your code, 2) include the MIT license comment in the file
and add the repo owner name to the license (you can add your name as well, if you so feel), 3) and make sure your code works and is complete.
We will not accept code that doesn't meet those 3 simple requirements. However if you would like to contribute monetarily then we can help.

## How do I donate to the project?
At the moment we do not take donations as this is currently a non-profit open source (NPOS) project. However, after v1.0.0.0 this will change.
The project will still be NPOS but we will have a Patreon that you can make donations to. All donations will help maintain an actual team
and possibly business that will take care of this community and the project together. This will also help with any legal fees we may come
across in the future beacuse well, s#@! happens.

## Is there a limit on how much I should donate or a base amount I should donate?
Simple answer is, "no". You can donate as much or as little as you want, but this doesn't apply when contributing code as formerly stated.

## What if I want to be a member of the project Team?
Well that's the beauty of open source projects, you can be apart of the team just by contributing! Since this was originally a one man project,
a formal team was never adopted so it will likely remain that way. However, if you want to apart of the Admin commitee (our group of Admins who
control what goes in and out of the repo) than you can email SoraKatadzuma at the email listed in his profile or at dungeonsandanime@gmail.com.

## So that's it, that's all?
Yep! Pretty simple right?

/**
 * This class defines a single rule or production in the grammar of a language.
 * It contains a head and a body; the head consists of a single {@code NonTerminal}
 * that will be the name and representation of the following body, where the body
 * is a list of {@code Terminals} and {@code NonTerminals}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Remember that a {@code Rule} is represented by {@code S → αBß}. This is what
 * we as can use to help identify what a {@code Item} should be and where we are
 * in parsing, because all we have to do is match the pattern. {@code S} is the
 * current start symbol or simply the head of the current production. {@code S}
 * is considered the start symbol if it is the head of the first rule of the
 * grammar but often times it is also used to represent the current start symbol
 * which is just the head of any latter rule or production. {@code →} literally
 * just tells us that there is a separation between the head and body of a rule
 * or production. {@code α} represent any number of previously seen {@code Terminal}s
 * and {@code NonTerminal}s. This can even mean that {@code α} can be 0. {@code B}
 * represents the {@code NonTerminal} we are currently on, as we only focus on
 * {@code NonTerminal}s when we are parsing. This is typically where we make a
 * jump to a different rule. And finally {@code ß} represents exactly what {@code α}
 * does but after the {@code NonTerminal} match {@code B}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is another two minor forms that are only prevalent when talking about
 * {@code Item} generation and {@code State} generation, but we'll mention them:
 * {@code B → γ} and {@code S → α·Bß}. The former just represents the insertion
 * of {@code NonTerminal B} with body {@code γ} into another production with the
 * {@code NonTerminal B} in it's body. And the latter represents an item, where
 * the dot ({@code ·}) represents the position in the production the {@code Item}
 * represents.

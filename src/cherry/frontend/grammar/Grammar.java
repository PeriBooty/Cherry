/**
 * This represents the entire grammar of the Cherry language. The following snippet
 * is from the previous but not removed {@code Rule.java} that meant to do what
 * this class does.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are a few discrepancies we must address:
 *  <ol>
 *      <li>
 *          There can never be more than one of any type of rule in the Grammar,
 *          which means we are unable to show multiple paths.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          Because of the first issue, this also has an effect on what can be
 *          epsilon and what cannot be.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          This will all ultimately to confusion and the breaking of the parser,
 *          unless we can understand a few fundamentals about how we plan to use
 *          these rules in reality.
 *      </li>
 *  </ol>
 * Let's look at it like this: a rule is a set of possible outcomes. Since we can
 * have multiple outcomes we need to be able to address multiple situations. If
 * we can adapt the information that the rule holds then we can affect how we
 * effectively generate the proper {@code Item}s and {@code State}s for the grammar.
 * All we really need to do, is make it so that each rule is actually a 2 dimensional
 * array of {@code Symbol}s. Why you may ask? Remember that thing about sets of
 * possible outcomes? We can only truly represent this by making it possible to
 * have more than one body in the rule, as you will see in the Grammar.md most,
 * if not all the rules, have at least 2 bodies to them.
 * </p>

## How do I register an issue?
You can register an issue by clicking the `Issues` tab below the repo name, and then clicking the `new issue` button.

## What are issues for?
Simple put, issues are for listing problems with the repo. If you see an typo in any of the documents or the source code then you can create
an issue for that, or if something isn't working right when using the binaries or executables of the project, then you can create an issue
for that.

# What are the issue guidelines?
A registered issue should do the following:
1. Explicitly name the problem in the title
2. Contain the proper tags for the issue.
    1. If a tag does not exist, then that is an issue of it's own and can easily be resolved. Just make sure to report it!
3. Point out the exact area that contains the problem
4. Provide examples if necessary
5. Provide code snippets if applicable or necessary
6. Be professional!
    1. This is a professional environment so we expect our community to act accordingly.
    
## That's it!
Once you have met those guidelines your issue is ready for publishing and reviewing by the rest of the community and the repo owner!
